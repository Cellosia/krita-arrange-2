<p>This plugin adds support to aligning a mix of paint, clone, group layers and more. It also adds a new type of layer spacing: Edge-to-edge. In this mode layers are placed side by side, without any gaps between them.</p>
<p>The original Arrange panel for vector layers can still be used when working with shapes inside a single vector layer. Enable the Move tool to use Arrange 2 with a mix of vector and other layers.</p>
<p>Arrange 2 also fixes a minor issue with the original arrange vector docker in which it'd resize by itself and squeeze other dockers whenever the Shapes tool was selected.</p>
<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Enable this plugin, the Arrange docker and restart Krita.</p>
